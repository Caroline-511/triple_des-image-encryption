# triple_des-image-encryption

This project primarily focuses on image encryption using triple DES algorithm. This 
project also tells us what the shortcomings of DES algorithm are and why triple DES 
is a more feasible solution to image encryption compared to DES. With the rapid 
development of various multimedia technologies, more and more multimedia data is 
being generated and transmitted in the modern day, also the internet allows for wide 
distribution of digital media data. It becomes much easier to edit, modify and 
duplicate the unencrypted original digital information. The digital documents are very 
easy to copy and distribute without consent from the original sender, therefore 
security and privacy is a major issue in the modern world, and also it has become a 
necessary to find the appropriate protection methods so as to ensure the data 
integrity. This is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and 
medical organizations collect, process, and store large amounts of data on 
computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive 
information, which needs to be protected. Organizations transmit sensitive data 
across networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, and cyber 
security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the 
systems used to process or store it.<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Triple DES</b><br/>
Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a type of computerized cryptography 
where block cipher algorithms are applied three times to each data block. The key 
size is increased in Triple DES to ensure additional security through encryption 
capabilities. Each block contains 64 bits of data. Three keys are referred to as 
bundle keys with 56 bits per key.<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Conclusion</b><br/>
In this project, the image encryption based on 
Triple DES was used for ensuring more security over DES. 
This project proves that Triple-Des provides a better quality 
encryption process where as we observed that des provides better performance in 
encryption and decryption process. This becomes a big flaw when we are running 
multiple process over a network. The time will be increased for Triple-DES process 
the future work would also concern the better assurance of quality and performance 
for all types of multimedia data.
